Network Scanning with ARP Requests 
 Function: `scan_network(ip_range)` Network scanning is a fundamental activity in cybersecurity, allowing administrators to identify active devices within a given IP range. The `scan_network` function utilizes Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests to discover devices.

This function sends ARP requests to the specified IP range and listens for responses, identifying devices based on their IP and MAC addresses. The use of Scapy's `srp` function allows for efficient packet sending and receiving, making it a powerful tool for network discovery.

 Port Checking 
 Function: `check_open_port(ip, port)` Port checking is crucial for identifying open ports that may be exploited by attackers. The `check_open_port` function attempts to establish a connection to a specified port on a given IP address.

By leveraging Python's `socket` library, this function determines whether a port is open, aiding in the identification of potential entry points for attackers.

 Vulnerability Scanning 
 Function: `vulnerability_scan(ip)` Vulnerability scanning is essential for identifying weaknesses in networked systems. The `vulnerability_scan` function uses nmap to perform a detailed scan for known vulnerabilities.

Nmap, a widely used network scanning tool, provides comprehensive vulnerability assessments through its scripting engine. This function integrates nmap's capabilities into Python, allowing for automated vulnerability scanning.

 Log Analysis 
 Function: `analyze_logs(log_file)` Log analysis is a critical component of security monitoring, helping to detect suspicious activities. The `analyze_logs` function examines log files for patterns indicative of security incidents.

This function uses regular expressions to identify lines in log files that match predefined suspicious patterns. By automating log analysis, administrators can quickly detect and respond to potential security incidents.

 Email Alerting 
 Function: `send_email_alert(subject, body, to_email)` Email alerts are a vital mechanism for notifying administrators of critical events. The `send_email_alert` function sends an email with a specified subject and body to a designated recipient.

Utilizing Python's `smtplib` library, this function facilitates the sending of email alerts, ensuring timely communication of critical information.

 File Integrity Monitoring 
 Function: `monitor_file_integrity(file_path)` File integrity monitoring is essential for detecting unauthorized changes to critical files. The `monitor_file_integrity` function calculates the hash of a file to verify its integrity.

By computing the SHA-256 hash of a file, this function allows administrators to detect changes and ensure the integrity of important files.

 System Information Gathering 
 Function: `gather_system_info()` Gathering system information is crucial for understanding the environment in which security measures are implemented. The `gather_system_info` function collects basic system information.

This function uses various libraries to collect information about the system's hostname, IP address, operating system, architecture, CPU count, and memory, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's configuration.
